# Exercise 26-4
#You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result that takes each word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.
#
# Do NOT Create a dictionary directly. Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop.

sentence = "What is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?"
# Don't change code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below:

result = {word: len(word) for word in sentence.split()}

print(result)


# Exercise 26-5
#You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called weather_f that takes each temperature in degrees Celsius and converts it into degrees Fahrenheit.

# To convert temp_c into temp_f:
#
# (temp_c * 9/5) + 32 = temp_f
#
# Do NOT Create a dictionary directly. Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop.

weather_c = {
    "Monday": 12,
    "Tuesday": 14,
    "Wednesday": 15,
    "Thursday": 14,
    "Friday": 21,
    "Saturday": 22,
    "Sunday": 24,
}
# ðŸš¨ Don't change code above ðŸ‘†


# Write your code ðŸ‘‡ below:

weather_f = {day: (temp * 9 / 5 + 32) for (day, temp) in weather_c.items()}

print(weather_f)
