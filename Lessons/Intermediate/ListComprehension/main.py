# Exercise 26-1
#You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers. This new list should contain every number in the list numbers but each number should be squared.

numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ğŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your 1 line code ğŸ‘‡ below:

squared_numbers = [n ** 2 for n in numbers]

#Write your code ğŸ‘† above:

print(squared_numbers)



# Exercise 26-2
# You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called result. This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers.

numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ğŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above

#Write your 1 line code ğŸ‘‡ below:

result = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]

#Write your code ğŸ‘† above:

print(result)
