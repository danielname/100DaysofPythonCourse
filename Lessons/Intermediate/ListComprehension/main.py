# Exercise 26-1
#You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers. This new list should contain every number in the list numbers but each number should be squared.

#Write your 1 line code ðŸ‘‡ below:

squared_numbers = [n ** 2 for n in numbers]

#Write your code ðŸ‘† above:

# Exercise 26-2
# You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called result. This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers.

#Write your code ðŸ‘† above:
