# Exercise 2-2
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
#
# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
#
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print(float(weight)/float(height)**2)



# Exercise 2-3
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
#
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
#
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
#
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

years_left = 90 - int(age)
days_left = years_left * 365
weeks_left = years_left * 52
months_left = years_left * 12

print(f"You have {days_left} days, {weeks_left} weeks, and {months_left} months left.")
